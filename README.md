# My Portfolio

Welcome to my Portfolio!
This portfolio website showcases my projects, experience and skillset. This website has been made using ThreeJS(3D Graphics Library on), Framer Motion for the animations and transitions in React and TailwindCSS(CSS Styling framework).

## Components

The website includes the following sections:

### 1. Introduction Section

The section features an introduction about myself along with a display picture, as well as a visually pleasing background that complements the overall theme of the site. Down below I've used a slider button animation which will take you to the next section.
